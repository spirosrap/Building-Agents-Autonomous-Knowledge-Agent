# Multi-Agent Architecture Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive multi-agent architecture for the Uda-hub agentic system, designed to provide intelligent customer support for CultPass users. The system employs a **Supervisor Pattern** with specialized agents working under the coordination of a central supervisor agent.

## Architecture Pattern

**Pattern**: Supervisor Pattern with Network Communication
- **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates the overall workflow and delegates tasks
- **Specialist Agents**: Handle specific domains of expertise
- **Network Communication**: Agents communicate through a shared state and message passing

## Information Flow and Decision-Making

### 1. Initial Request Processing
```
User Query → Supervisor Agent → Intent Analysis → Agent Selection → Task Delegation
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
```
Supervisor → Specialist Agent(s) → Tool Execution → Response Generation → Supervisor Review
```

### 3. Response Synthesis
```
Agent Responses → Supervisor Synthesis → Quality Check → Final Response → User
```

### 4. Escalation Flow
```
Complex Query → Supervisor Analysis → Human Escalation → Response Tracking
```

## Input/Output Handling

### Input Types
1. **Text Queries**: User questions and requests
2. **Context Information**: Previous conversation history
3. **User Data**: Account information and preferences
4. **System Events**: Notifications and alerts

### Output Types
1. **Text Responses**: Direct answers to user queries
2. **Action Confirmations**: Results of performed actions
3. **Escalation Notifications**: When human intervention is needed
4. **Follow-up Questions**: For clarification or additional information

### Input Processing
- **Intent Classification**: Determine user's primary intent
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify relevant entities (users, events, etc.)
- **Context Analysis**: Consider conversation history and user state
- **Priority Assessment**: Determine urgency and complexity

### Output Generation
