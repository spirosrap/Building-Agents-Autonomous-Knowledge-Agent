# Task Routing and Role Assignment Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Specification Compliance**

✅ **System can classify incoming tickets and route them to appropriate agents**
✅ **Routing logic considers ticket content and metadata**
✅ **At least one routing decision is made based on ticket classification**
✅ **Code includes routing logic that can be demonstrated with sample tickets**
✅ **Routing follows the architecture design principles**

## 🤖 **Intelligent Ticket Router**

### Core Components

#### **TicketRouter Class** (`agentic/ticket_router.py`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent task routing and role assignment across agents
- **Input**: Ticket content and metadata
- **Output**: Routing decision with agent recommendations

#### **Classification System**
- **TicketCategory**: Technical, Billing, Account, General, Escalation
- **TicketPriority**: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- **TicketComplexity**: Simple, Moderate, Complex

#### **Metadata Analysis**
- User type (premium vs standard)
- Account status (blocked vs active)
- Ticket age and previous history
- Urgency indicators and escalation requirements

## 🔧 **Routing Logic Implementation**

### 1. Content Classification
```python
# Keyword-based classification
classification_keywords = {
    "technical": ["login", "password", "error", "bug", "crash", "not working"],
    "billing": ["payment", "subscription", "billing", "refund", "charge"],
    "account": ["account", "profile", "preferences", "settings", "transfer"],
    "escalation": ["urgent", "emergency", "critical", "human", "agent"]
}
```

### 2. Priority Assessment
```python
# Priority scoring based on content and metadata
priority_scores = {
    "urgent": ["urgent", "emergency", "critical", "immediately"],
    "high": ["important", "priority", "high", "serious"],
    "medium": ["issue", "problem", "question", "help"],
    "low": ["inquiry", "information", "general", "curious"]
}
```

### 3. Complexity Evaluation
```python
# Complexity indicators
complexity_indicators = {
    "complex": ["multiple", "several", "various", "complex", "complicated"],
    "moderate": ["issue", "problem", "trouble", "difficulty"],
    "simple": ["simple", "basic", "quick", "easy", "straightforward"]
}
```

### 4. Agent Assignment Logic
```python
# Category-based agent mapping
category_agents = {
    TicketCategory.TECHNICAL: ["TECHNICAL"],
    TicketCategory.BILLING: ["BILLING"],
    TicketCategory.ACCOUNT: ["ACCOUNT"],
    TicketCategory.GENERAL: ["KNOWLEDGE_BASE"],
    TicketCategory.ESCALATION: ["ESCALATION"]
}

# Complex tickets get multiple agents
if complexity == TicketComplexity.COMPLEX:
    base_agents.extend(["KNOWLEDGE_BASE", "RAG"])
```

## 📊 **Integration with Multi-Agent Workflow**

### Workflow Integration
```python
# Enhanced supervisor node with ticket routing
def _supervisor_node(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Create ticket metadata
    ticket_metadata = {
        "ticket_id": state.get("user_context", {}).get("conversation_id"),
        "user_id": state.get("user_context", {}).get("user_id"),
        "created_at": datetime.now(),
        "user_type": state.get("user_context", {}).get("user_type", "standard"),
        "user_blocked": state.get("user_context", {}).get("user_blocked", False)
    }
    
    # Route ticket using intelligent routing
    routing_decision = self.ticket_router.route_ticket(user_message, ticket_metadata)
    
    # Update state with routing information
    state["routing_decision"] = routing_decision
    state["escalation_required"] = routing_decision.get("requires_escalation", False)
```

### Enhanced Routing Decision
```python
def _route_decision(self, state: AgentState) -> str:
    routing_decision = state.get("routing_decision", {})
    
    # Use routing decision for agent selection
    recommended_agents = routing_decision.get("recommended_agents", ["KNOWLEDGE_BASE"])
    category = routing_decision.get("category", "general")
    complexity = routing_decision.get("complexity", "moderate")
    
    # For complex tickets, use multi-agent approach
    if complexity == "complex" and len(recommended_agents) > 1:
        return "multi_agent"
    
    # Map category to agent
    category_agent_map = {
        "technical": "technical",
        "billing": "billing", 
        "account": "account",
        "general": "knowledge_base",
        "escalation": "escalation"
    }
    
    return category_agent_map.get(category, "knowledge_base")
```

## 🧪 **Testing and Validation**

### Sample Tickets Tested
1. **Technical Issue**: Login problems with premium user
2. **Billing Question**: Subscription cost and refund inquiry
3. **Account Management**: Preferences update and account transfer
4. **General Inquiry**: Event availability and cultural experiences
5. **Escalation Request**: Urgent human agent request with security concerns
6. **Complex Issue**: Multiple technical and billing problems
7. **Simple Question**: Basic event reservation inquiry

router = TicketRouter()
routing_decision = router.route_ticket(
    "I can't log into my account, my password isn't working",
    {"user_type": "premium", "user_blocked": False}
)

print(f"Category: {routing_decision['category']}")
print(f"Priority: {routing_decision['priority']}")
print(f"Recommended Agents: {routing_decision['recommended_agents']}")

    conversation_id="conv-456"
)

# Routing decision is available in the result
routing_info = result.get("routing_decision", {})
