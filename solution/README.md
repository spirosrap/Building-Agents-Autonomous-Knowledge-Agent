- `database_management.ipynb` - Comprehensive database setup notebook
- `test_database_setup.py` - Verification script for database setup
- `data/external/cultpass_articles.jsonl` - Enhanced with 15 support articles
- `01_external_db_setup.ipynb` - External database setup (CultPass)
- `02_core_db_setup.ipynb` - Core database setup (Uda-hub)

#### Database Files (Generated)
- `data/external/cultpass.db` - CultPass external database
- `data/core/udahub.db` - Uda-hub core database

### How to Run

#### Option 1: Use the Simple Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd solution
python setup_databases.py
```
This script will set up both databases and run verification tests automatically.

#### Option 2: Use the Comprehensive Database Management Notebook
